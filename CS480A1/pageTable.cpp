/*/
 * Design and implement clean interfaces between modules.
 * Meaningful variable names.
 * NO global variables.
 * NO hard code â€“ Magic numbers, etc.
 * Have proper code structure between .h and.cpp files
 *
 * General outline
 * 1.) construct level bit masks
 * 2.) calculate right shifting to get page number for each level
 * 3.) apply bitwise AND operation using mask, then right shifting
 *
 * bitMaskAry[], shiftArray[], entryCount[] should be computed  dynamically based on pageTable specification
 * memory address = page number * page size + offset into the page.
 * page number = memory address / page size
 * offset into the page = memory address mod page size
